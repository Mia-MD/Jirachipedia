## Jirachipedia
A simple encyclopedia web application I made for Angela Yu's Fullstack Web Devlopment Bootcamp. It uses the PokeAPI to get information about all the different pokemon. To run it, simply download the repository. Install the
necessary node modules with
```
npm i
```
then run it with 
```
nodemon server.js
```
It should run on port 3000. **Have fun!**
